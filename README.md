## Definition of ‘Koan’

Kōan is a zen word meaning the enlightenment or awakening of a person, usually through a puzzle or riddle. The most
common one is "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"

## What is this all about?

AssertJ is a fluent assertions library to help with writing more expressive tests. AssertJ produces better error messages
and a lot more functionality than standard JUnit assertions.

These Koans are an interactive and fun way to be introduced to and learn how to test with AssertJ.

## Current Lessons

- Basic Assertions
- Collection Assertions
- Exception Assertions
- BDDAssertions
- Custom Assertions

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and open it up in your preferred IDE.

Run the unit test, see it fail, then fill in the blank ("____"). Run it again to see it pass.

## Tips & Tricks

- *Play*: Experimentation is a powerful learning tool. Don't be afraid to try stuff out, and run it to see what happens.
- *Run the Test*: It is valuable to see what the results are. All Koans are designed to produce something even before
  they are filled in.
- *Debug*: Set some break point and walk through the code. It's a great way to get details. ({"Ctrl+R, Ctrl+T"}) will
  run in debug mode.
- *Do Them with a Friend*: Learning is more fun and less frustrating when you have a friend with you.
- *Retrospect after each Koan*: True insight comes from reflecting on the answer, not just obtaining it.
